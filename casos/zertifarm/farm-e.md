title: Comparative Analysis of Grazing Regimes (Beira Baixa)
sidebar_label: Organic Grazing (Beira Baixa)
---

## Context & Location

* Beira Baixa, mainland Portugal
* Mediterranean climate
* Grassland-based pastoral system

## Objectives

* Compare soil health outcomes under different grazing regimes
* Assess the results of soil health parameters in a plot without soil corrections in the last years

## Problem Description

Although this farm is an organic farm, it has problems related to poor soil nutrition, drainage, and productivity. It is important to implement a well-managed grazing system to improve soil health and nutrition.

## Proposed Approach / Pilot Logic

Implementation of grazing and bale grazing in a low productivity plot.

## Data & Measurements

* Soil chemistry: pH, organic matter, N, P, K, Ca, S, Mo
* Soil biology: microbial diversity and pathogen presence
* Indicators of compaction and nutrient excess

## Key Findings (Preliminary)

* Absence of micronutrients such as molybdenum, copper, cobalt, nickel, boron and zinc
* High saturation restricting the capacity of retain nutrient cations
* High potential for mycotoxin production

## Expected Value

* Improve nutritional value of pasture for livestock
* Improve organic matter status
* Improve micronutrients availability in soil

## Why this pilot matters

It highlights that **organic management alone is not sufficient**, and that adaptive grazing and regenerative soil practices are essential to restore soil function and long-term productivity.
