## Context & Location

* Alentejo (southern Portuguese interior), mainland Portugal
* Mediterranean climate
* Mixed arable and pastoral system

## Objectives

* Assess the influence on soil of the production of *Barbela* wheat

## Problem Description

This farm has gradually transformed a conventional arable operation into a diversified regenerative project focused on soil health. The goal is the implementation of a different wheat variety that is resilient and resistant to poor soil conditions. Moreover, this kind of wheat has lower gluten content and is more digestible, which is important for its use in human consumption.

## Proposed Approach / Pilot Logic

Analysis of two samples of a 10-ha plot before and after the application of the *Barbela* wheat, with the application of cover crops.

## Data & Measurements

* Soil chemistry: pH, organic matter, N, P, K, Ca, S, Mo
* Soil biology: microbial diversity and pathogen presence
* Indicators of compaction and nutrient excess

## Key Findings (Preliminary)

* Critical phosphorus shortage in both sampling points
* Microbiological analysis showed variability among sampling points related to management
* Excessive amounts of calcium and magnesium

## Observed Value

* Increase of total nitrogen and narrower C:N ratio suggesting more labile organic matter
* Phosphorus shortage persisted
* Slight decrease in the pH indicating progressive acidification

## Why this pilot matters

It highlights the benefits of the use of **autochthonous crops species**, and their influence on soil health and nutrition.
