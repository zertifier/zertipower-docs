title: Management Regenerative Practices in Different Plots (Azores)
sidebar_label: Microenvironments (Azores)

## Context & Location

* Azores, Portugal island
* Oceanic subtropical climate
* Mixed arable and pastoral system

## Objectives

* Compare management impacts in different plots with different microenvironments

## Problem Description

A single farm can show different microenvironments and soil properties due to different management practices. The sampling of different areas' strategy reveals significant variability in soil development and productivity potential.

## Proposed Approach / Pilot Logic

Three plots with different management.

Implementation of seed mixture through direct sowing, to increase the protein amount.

## Data & Measurements

* Soil chemistry: pH, organic matter, N, P, K, Ca, S, Mo
* Soil biology: microbial diversity and pathogen presence
* Indicators of compaction and nutrient excess

## Key Findings (Preliminary)

* Critical phosphorus shortage in all plots
* Soil compaction and poor drainage (in two plots)
* Microbiological analysis showed zonal variability reflecting different land use.

## Expected Value

* Amendment of phosphorus and micronutrient to avoid yield suppression
* Increase diversification using crops consociation
* Mitigate the risk of fungal presence

## Why this pilot matters

It highlights that **in a single farm we can have different microenvironments**, and that soil analysis and corrections together with the implementation of regenerative practices are essential to restore soil function and long-term productivity.
