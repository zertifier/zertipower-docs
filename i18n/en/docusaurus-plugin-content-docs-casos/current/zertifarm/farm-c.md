## Context & Location

* Beira Baixa region, mainland Portugal  
* Mediterranean climate  
* Organic beef cattle production

## Objectives

* Compare soil health outcomes under different grazing and soil mobilization regimes  
* Assess long-term effects of regenerative grazing practices

## Problem Description

Even organic systems can suffer from soil degradation if grazing pressure and soil disturbance are not properly managed. There is limited empirical evidence comparing long-term grazing, no-till, and ungrazed plots within the same system.

## Proposed Approach / Pilot Logic

Three plots were monitored:

1. Grazed plot  
2. No-till plot (no mobilization for ≥10 years)  
3. Ungrazed plot (no animals for ≥3 years)

This design enables time-dependent and practice-based comparison.

## Data & Measurements

* Soil chemistry and nutrient balance  
* Soil microbiome (16S, ITS)  
* Indicators of compaction and biological stress

## Key Findings (Preliminary)

* Lower organic matter compared to other farms  
* Signs of compaction across plots  
* Nutrient limitations (e.g. molybdenum below detection limits)

## Expected / Observed Value

* Highlights limits of “organic-only” approaches  
* Provides evidence for adaptive grazing, subsoiling, and regenerative interventions  
* Supports context-based management rather than one-size-fits-all practices

## Why this pilot matters

 It highlights that **organic management alone is not sufficient**, and that adaptive grazing and regenerative soil practices are essential to restore soil function and long-term productivity.
