## Context & Location

* Alentejo (southern Portuguese interior), mainland Portugal
* Mediterranean climate
* Grassland-based pastoral system

## Objectives

* Assess the benefits of rotational grazing
* Assess long-term effects of regenerative grazing practices

## Problem Description

Although this farm is managed under regenerative principles, it shows soil nutritional deficiencies. It is important to optimize grazing efficiency and contribute to improving soil health.

## Proposed Approach / Pilot Logic

Implement rotational grazing with 1.8-ha paddocks to allow grass recovery.

## Data & Measurements

* Soil chemistry: pH, organic matter, N, P, K, Ca, S, Mo
* Soil biology: microbial diversity and pathogen presence
* Indicators of compaction and nutrient excess

## Key Findings (Preliminary)

* Critical deficiencies of micronutrients such as molybdenum, zinc and boron
* Vulnerability to biotic and abiotic stress
* Phosphorus deficiency

## Expected Value

* Expected the optimization of grazing efficiency

## Why this pilot matters

It highlights that **grazing alone is not sufficient**, and that adaptive regenerative soil practices and soil analysis and correction are essential to restore soil function and long-term productivity.
