## Context & Location

* São Miguel Island, Azores (Portugal)  
* Atlantic climate, high biomass potential  
* Conventional dairy cow production system

## Objectives

* Assess the effect of regenerative practices on soil health indicators  
* Compare conventional high-mobilisation cropping with improved soil management approaches

## Problem Description

Farm A operates a **conventional silage production system** with two annual crops (maize and ryegrass), involving frequent soil mobilization and fertilization. Such systems are prone to soil compaction, biodiversity loss, and nutrient imbalances, increasing dependency on external inputs and vulnerability to climate variability.

## Proposed Approach / Pilot Logic

A \~2 ha plot was monitored using:

* Physical–chemical soil analysis  
* Soil microbiome profiling (16S and ITS sequencing)

The pilot evaluates how current management practices affect soil structure, nutrient balance, and microbial health, establishing a baseline for regenerative transitions.

## Data & Measurements

* Soil chemistry: pH, organic matter, N, P, K, Ca, S, Mo  
* Soil biology: microbial diversity and pathogen presence  
* Indicators of compaction and nutrient excess

## Key Findings (Preliminary)

* High nutrient levels but **low base exchange capacity**  
* Evidence of **soil compaction** and presence of *Pythium sp.*  
* Reduced soil biodiversity linked to frequent mobilization

## Expected / Observed Value

* Identification of practices limiting soil regeneration  
* Evidence supporting reduced tillage, cover crops, and direct seeding  
* Scientific basis to guide regenerative transition without yield loss

## Why this pilot matters

It represents a **high-input conventional baseline**, making it critical for demonstrating how regenerative practices (reduced tillage, cover crops) can improve soil health without compromising productivity.
