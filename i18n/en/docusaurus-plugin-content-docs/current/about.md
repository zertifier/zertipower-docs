## RegenAg-X: Harvest the hidden value in your farm data

RegenAg-X is a lighthouse data space specialized in regenerative agricultural systems, designed to enable a federated, secure and auditable environment for agrifood data exchange and processing. Its objective is to validate—under real operational conditions—the technical, organisational and economic capabilities required to operate a sector-specific data space aligned with principles of data sovereignty, secure computation and decentralised governance.

The lighhouse incorporates a technical support model to facilitate the participation of farmers, cooperatives, technology companies and research institutions that lack the resources to independently develop complex applications. This approach allows for precise assessment of integration, standardisation and service orchestration requirements across the agrifood supply chain.

## Governance and operational roles

RegenAg-X is governed by an explicit governance framework that defines responsibilities, access rules and technical oversight mechanisms. The model guarantees fairness, non-discrimination and sustainability, and establishes procedures for participant onboarding and policy management.

Participants in the space may assume different operational roles:

* Data providers  
* Data consumers  
* Processing service providers  
* Infrastructure and ecosystem-service operators  
* Trusted intermediaries responsible for controlled execution of processes on sensitive data

Role assignment is managed through verifiable identities based on Web3 technologies.

## Technical architecture and secure computation

The lighthouse integrates advanced compute-to-data capabilities through the Ocean Enterprise Collective, enabling processes to be executed directly on source datasets without transferring or replicating them. This preserves confidentiality and ensures data sovereignty by design.

The architecture includes:

* Web3 protocols and Verifiable Credentials (VCs) for authentication, authorization and auditing  
* Secure computation services for advanced analytics, AI and federated learning  
* Standardised containers (Docker/Kubernetes) to encapsulate data-processing services  
* Traceability and accounting mechanisms based on a distributed ledger supporting verifiable transactions and smart contracts

These capabilities enable granular usage policies, real-time compliance validation, and monetization models based on access, query execution or compute cycles.

## Interoperability and semantics

RegenAg-X incorporates semantic transformation services to ensure interoperability across heterogeneous data sources.

The semantic model includes:

* Normalisation of formats (JSON, CSV, XML)  
* Ontology mappings and domain vocabularies for agricultural and regenerative scenarios
* Automatic validation of structures and usage conditions  
* Publication in federated catalogues for discovery and reuse

This approach allows data from IoT sensors, agricultural machinery, telemetry, farm-management systems or open datasets to be integrated and processed in a uniform manner.

## Data economy and incentive mechanisms

The lighthouse implements data-economy capabilities enabled by the Ocean Enterprise Collective:

* Publication of datasets and computational services as tokenised assets  
* Execution under smart contracts governing permissions and compensation  
* Automatic settlement of transactions via verifiable accounting  
* Incentive models to promote participation and contribution of high-value data

The distributed ledger infrastructure maintains an auditable history of all operations executed within the data space.

## Resource availability

RegenAg-X hosts:

* Proprietary resources shared under defined usage conditions  
* Advanced computational services (descriptive, predictive and prescriptive analytics)  
* High-value open datasets relevant to regenerative agriculture (earth observation, climate, soil, biodiversity, etc.)
